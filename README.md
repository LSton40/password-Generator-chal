# password-Generator-chal

##Challenge
```
The posted challenge was to operationalize in Javascript and random password generator. Upon clicking the button on the webpage, the user would select an inclusive number between 8 and 128 for the number of characters in the password, then would select the character types to be included: lowercase, uppercase, numerals, and special characters.
The user would make their selections via a webpage prompt (or confirm prompt) and, after all selections, the randomly generated password should be inserted into the pages textbox.
The HTML and CSS for the page were provided, as was some of the Javascript required to communicate with the HTML page.
```

##The Added Code
```
The code I added involved, within the provided function: 1) creating the prompts to collate the user's selections, as well as to give them validation should they fail to give a response within the specified criteria; 2) providing code to randomly generate a text string within the specified length composed of the specified sets of characters.
The provided Javascript code then would insert the output of the function into the webpages textbox as the randomly generated password.
